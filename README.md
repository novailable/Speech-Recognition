How does this program work?

Single audio file input:

The audio is divided into segments based on the number of cores in the CPU. Then, each segment is transcribed, and the results are printed out after the process.

Multiple audio file input:

Each audio file is transcribed based on the number of cores in the CPU. Therefore, depending on the length and density of the audio file, the shortest one will be processed first, even if it is the last input.
